NAME
    "Tickit" - Terminal Interface Construction KIT

SYNOPSIS
     use Tickit;

     my $tickit = Tickit->new;

     # Create some widgets
     # ...

     $tickit->set_root_widget( $rootwidget );

     $tickit->run;

DESCRIPTION
CONSTRUCTOR
  $tickit = Tickit->new( %args )
    Constructs a new "Tickit" framework container object.

    Takes the following named arguments at construction time:

    term_in => IO
            IO handle for terminal input. Will default to "STDIN".

    term_out => IO
            IO handle for terminal output. Will default to "STDOUT".

    UTF8 => BOOL
            If defined, overrides locale detection to enable or disable
            UTF-8 mode. If not defined then this will be detected from the
            locale by using Perl's "${^UTF8LOCALE}" variable.

METHODS
  $tickit->is_utf8
    Returns true if running in UTF-8 mode; returned keypress events and
    displayed text will be Unicode aware. If false, then keypresses and
    displayed text will work in legacy 8-bit mode.

  $tickit->later( $code )
    Runs the given CODE reference at some time soon in the future. It will
    not be invoked yet, but will be invoked at some point before the next
    round of input events are processed.

  $term = $tickit->term
    Returns the underlying Tickit::Term object.

  $cols = $tickit->cols
  $lines = $tickit->lines
    Query the current size of the terminal. Will be cached and updated on
    receipt of "SIGWINCH" signals.

  $tickit->bind_key( $key, $code )
    Installs a callback to invoke if the given key is pressed, overwriting
    any previous callback for the same key. The code block is invoked as

     $code->( $tickit, $key )

    If $code is missing or "undef", any existing callback is removed.

    As a convenience for the common application use case, the "Ctrl-C" key
    is bound to the "_STOP" method.

    To remove this binding, simply bind another callback, or remove the
    binding entirely by setting "undef".

  $tickit->rootwin
    Returns the Tickit::RootWindow.

  $tickit->set_root_widget( $widget )
    Sets the root widget for the application's display. This must be a
    subclass of Tickit::Widget.

  $tickit->start
    Set up the screen and generally prepare to start running

  $tickit->stop
    Shut down the screen after running

  $tickit->run
    Calls the "start" method, then processes IO events until stopped, by the
    "_STOP" method, "SIGINT", "SIGTERM" or the "Ctrl-C" key. Then runs the
    "stop" method, and returns.
