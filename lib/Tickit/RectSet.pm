=head1 NAME

C<Tickit::RectSet> - store a set of rectangular regions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects in this class store a set of rectangular regions. The object tracks
which areas are covered, to ensure that overlaps are avoided, and that
neighbouring regions are merged where possible. The order in which they are
added is not important.

New regions can be added using the C<add> method. The C<rects> method returns
a list of non-overlapping L<Tickit::Rect> regions, in top-to-bottom,
left-to-right order.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 $rectset = Tickit::RectSet->new

Returns a new C<Tickit::RectSet> instance, initially empty.

=cut

=head1 METHODS

=cut

=head2 @rects = $rectset->rects

Returns a list of the covered regions, in order first top to bottom, then left
to right.

=cut

=head2 $rectset->add( $rect )

Adds the region covered by C<$rect> to the stored region list.

=cut

=head2 $rectset->subtract( $rect )

Removes any covered region that intersects with C<$rect> from the stored
region list.

=cut

=head2 $rectset->clear

Remove all the regions from the set.

=cut

=head2 $bool = $rectset->intersects( $rect )

Returns true if C<$rect> intersects with any region in the set.

=cut

=head2 $bool = $rectset->contains( $rect )

Returns true if C<$rect> is entirely covered by the regions in the set. Note
that it may be that the rect requires two or more regions in the set to
completely cover it.
