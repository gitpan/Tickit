=head1 NAME

C<Tickit::StringPos> - store string position counters

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Tickit::StringPos;
 use Tickit::Utils qw( string_count );

 my $pos = Tickit::StringPos->zero;
 string_count( "Here is a message", $pos );

 print "The message consumes ", $pos->columns, " columns\n";

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Instances in this object class store four position counters that relate to
counting strings.

The C<bytes> member counts UTF-8 bytes which encode individual codepoints. For
example the Unicode character U+00E9 is encoded by two bytes 0xc3, 0xa9; it
would increment the bytes counter by 2 and the C<codepoints> counter by 1.

The C<codepoints> member counts individual Unicode codepoints.

The C<graphemes> member counts whole composed grahical clusters of codepoints,
where combining accents which count as individual codepoints do not count as
separate graphemes. For example, the codepoint sequence U+0065 U+0301 would
increment the C<codepoint> counter by 2 and the C<graphemes> counter by 1.

The C<columns> member counts the number of screen columns consumed by the
graphemes. Most graphemes consume only 1 column, but some are defined in
Unicode to consume 2.

Instances are also used to store count limits, where any memeber may be set
to -1 to indicate no limit in that counter.

=head1 CONSTRUCTORS

=head2 $pos = Tickit::StringPos->zero

Returns a new instance with all counters set to zero.

=head2 $pos = Tickit::StringPos->limit_bytes( $bytes )

=head2 $pos = Tickit::StringPos->limit_codepoints( $codepoints )

=head2 $pos = Tickit::StringPos->limit_graphemes( $graphemes )

=head2 $pos = Tickit::StringPos->limit_columns( $columns )

Return a new instance with one counter set to the given limit and the other
three counters set to -1.
